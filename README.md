***Project overview:***

The main purpose of the analysis was to help Louise on taking a data analysis driven decision on when to launch her campaign of plays, fetching and digging into the given data of campaigns outcomes based on launch Dates, and their goals outcome, will be the final decision.

***Analysis and challenges:***

As we see in the charts of outcomes based on launch dates that the best timing to launch the campaign Is June, with the highest successful rates, on the other hand the outcomes VS goals charts shows the plays comes with zero cancelation percentage, and high successful percentage with the tendency spreading more successfully in my opinion in the middle lower Quartile.

* chart outcomes based on launch date.

* chart outcomes Vs goals.

As being challenging situations, the data could be more useful if we had the chance to have a comparison of the length of the plays , duration , or how many locations this plays shows at , 
The equations and analysis sometimes seem repetitive to get one outcome. Time consuming 
Syntax errors could be time consuming as well.



***Results :***


As mentioned earlier the best outcome of launch date analysis is that the best timing is June , although may and June in my opinion are relatively close to each other .and dec is the most weak month to be avoided .
In the outcome vs goals I would advise to have more focus on figures between -1000-5000 as they make the successful factors for this campaign.
I would recommend analysing further to find the second-best options and third, to prepare for second and third scenario.
